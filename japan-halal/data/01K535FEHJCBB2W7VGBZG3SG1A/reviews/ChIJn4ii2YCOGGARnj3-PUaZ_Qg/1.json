A quick check on Google Maps showed it was within walking distance, so my friend and I made our way there, arriving at about 5.30 pm for an early dinner. The streets around Uguisudani were quiet at that hour, and when we stepped inside the restaurant, it was almost empty, giving us the feeling of having the whole place to ourselves.\n\nThe owners, originally from Samarkand in Uzbekistan, welcomed us warmly. Their friendliness immediately made the place feel homely rather than just another restaurant in central Tokyo. The d\u00e9cor had touches of Central Asia, with patterned fabrics on the booths and a low table with cushions by the window, but what really mattered was the food\u2014and it turned out to be the best part of the evening.\n\nWe decided to start with a hearty spread, and the first dish that came to our table was the kebab set. It was an impressive sight: eight skewers lined neatly on a wooden board, with each stick offering something different. There were lamb kebabs, beef, chicken, and minced meat, all charred just enough to lock in the juices, with alternating pieces of tomato, onion, and green pepper. The smoky aroma rose as soon as the platter landed on the table, and each bite lived up to that promise\u2014tender, flavorful, and satisfying. The kebabs were served with a side of fries, a simple coleslaw salad, and a tangy tomato sauce that gave a nice kick. It was generous enough that two people could comfortably share, though we happily tried every skewer.\n\nNext came the plov, or osh as it\u2019s also called\u2014the national dish of Uzbekistan. This was pure comfort food. A large plate of rice, fragrant and slightly oily in the best way, was topped with chunks of tender lamb, soft chickpeas, and strips of sweet carrot. The addition of boiled quail eggs made it even more traditional. The flavor was rich but not heavy, the kind of dish that feels like it could easily be a full meal on its own. Eating it in Tokyo, just a short walk away from the museum and the city buzz, felt like we had been transported to another part of the world.\n\nWe also had a bowl of lamb soup, which was light but warming. The broth was golden and clear, with pieces of lamb, carrots, and red peppers floating in it. It was seasoned gently, not overpowering, which made it a perfect balance to the stronger flavors of the kebabs and plov. It reminded me of the kind of soup that would be served at the beginning of a family meal\u2014comforting and simple, something that prepared the stomach for the bigger dishes.\n\nTo wash it all down, we each had a cup of ayran, the salted yogurt drink that\u2019s so common across Central Asia. Cold and slightly tangy, it was exactly what we needed with the grilled meats, cutting through the richness and refreshing the palate. By the end of the meal, we both agreed that without ayran, the kebabs wouldn\u2019t have felt quite as complete.\n\nWhen the bill arrived, it came to \u00a57,200 for two people. Slightly on the higher side for a casual dinner, but given the quality of the food, the portion sizes, and the fact that we were in central Tokyo eating authentic Uzbek halal cuisine, it felt fair.\n\nHalal Sakura isn\u2019t just about eating\u2014it\u2019s about experiencing something different in the heart of Tokyo. The food was excellent, each dish prepared with care, and the owners\u2019 warmth made the evening even better. Walking back, full and content, I thought about how unexpected it was to find a little slice of Uzbekistan hidden away in a Tokyo neighborhood. For us, it was a perfect dinner after a long day of sightseeing, and it\u2019s a place I\u2019d happily return to.",

It has two floors and the seating is comfortable, with corner seating for large groups. Upstairs, there are clean restrooms and a prayer area. They served us hot black tea as a gift. We ordered ayran, which was delicious except it wasn't cold. We ordered manti, which was great. They also ordered lamb kebab and samosa, and the dough was special. I thank the owner of the restaurant. We came this year especially for him, and we ordered samurai and product, which were delicious as usual, and ayran was even better. We ordered pasta, which was good, but we were full. We took our food with us. I thank them for not serving alcohol."
