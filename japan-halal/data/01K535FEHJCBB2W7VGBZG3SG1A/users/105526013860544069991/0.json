Even though the whole staff is very kind, I would like to point out Felix and Phom who were both extraordinary friendly and welcomed us in a family atmosphere. What I also liked is the fact that in contrast to other japanese restaurants there was no language barrier at all. Each staff member speaks English very well and we could even talk in German with Felix. Thank you very much for the great experience and the delicious food! \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ufe0f",
