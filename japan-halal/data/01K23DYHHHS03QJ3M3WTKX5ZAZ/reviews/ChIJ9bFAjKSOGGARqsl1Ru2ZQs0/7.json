He had a stern expression and lacked the courtesy that Japanese people should have. Maybe he was not Japanese; or maybe they mainly wanted to greet foreign guests. As a Hong Konger, I felt a little uncomfortable. The beef is delicious, but I think it is quite expensive, so I hope it tastes better. But I think it might be more pleasant to go to other authentic Japanese stores. The waiter was very nice."
