They also directly ask for positive Google Maps reviews when you finish eating and for Instagram photos before you even start. It's very pandery and diminishes the meal a lot. Be aware this affects existing ratings.\n\nI ordered the (as of June 2025) 6,000 yen ramen set which came with ramen, two wagyu sushis, two chicken karages, and a drink. Each part arrived at different times instead of together as a set. This meant parts were cooling down while other parts were fresh hot. I was asked if they could take my photo for Instagram the moment my ramen arrived...I just wanted to eat. They also asked other groups if they could take their photo for Instagram.\n\nThe miso ramen is very rich and thick. The flavor is very good, but probably not worthy of being a 6,000 yen showpiece. The plating could be prettier and showcase the generous amount of ingredients. Try not to drink anything but water with your meal or else you'll wash out the flavor. The karage is reminiscent of American style fried chicken tenders. They're very heavy with a thick crust and not the usual delicate fry. The sushi was good but felt a little underwhelming.\n\nThere are just so many little things they don't account for, as if they haven't tried being a guest at their own restaurant. If you're eating at the counter, a fan regularly blows on you so your food gets cold. Don't give somebody food just to ask for a photo - ask before it arrives, not when they're excited to eat. Don't offer a farewell sticker but also ask for a positive Google review. Servers shouldn't use the counter near the only eating guest to get meals from the kitchen for other tables - use the other counter away from the guest that you switched to later on anyway. And don't stand one meter away from a guest the entire time they're eating while doing nothing. It's awkward.\n\nStaff might be very friendly, and the food itself is very good (however overpriced), but those details drag the restaurant down. A 6,000 set should also come with more thoughtfulness. Visiting here with a group is fine, but if alone it's less than great. Stop asking for positive Google reviews, and consider getting more independent feedback.",
