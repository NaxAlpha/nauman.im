I get exactly what I come for....a workout that has me sweaty, tired, and feeling accomplished when I walk out the doors. I try and come every day and every day the workout is different. It can be anything from flipping tires and doing cross training to sparring in the ring with classmates to boxing techniques to calisthenics to kickboxing. Your body gets worked and you'll never get bored because it's always something different.\n\nThe coaches are amazing. I can't say enough about the coaches. Coach Cesar and Rich are always walking around making sure your technique and body movements are correct and giving encouraging words that motivate you to push yourself even harder. They are very knowledgeable coaches that really care about what they are teaching and believe me they will make sure you get a good workout in.\n\nThe staff is awesome too. They are super friendly and always make you feel welcomed. I love this place. It's a comfortable environment with a family atmosphere.",
