It was truly wonderful to see your smile!\nIn addition to Edomae sushi, a style that has been passed down since the Edo period, we also offer sushi made with Wagyu beef, which is a must-try when visiting Japan. Since our restaurant originally served omakase course meals, we also offer a wider variety of sushi, Japan's famous tofu, and traditional desserts. We also offer Wagyu burgers and ramen, so there is something for everyone. We hope you have a wonderful stay in Japan.",
