                <p>Google Cloud Platform is one of the leading cloud platforms. It is the fastest growing platform right now. One of the major feature GCP offers compared to other cloud platforms is simplicity. As a developer or a DevOps engineer, all you have, the least steep learning curve. All you have to do is perform a few clicks and you are ready to go, you can do complex configurations later on.</p>

                <p>Unlike traditional hosting, where you have to manage always running VMs which scale up and down but cost you 24/7 when running, serverless only costs you when a user visits your website or your API is called.</p>

                <p>Serverless is very popular right now but it has some major caveats. You have to follow the vendor's rules to configure your project structure. e.g. AWS says you have to structure your project in ABC ways in order for it to be run on AWS Lambda. Same goes for Google and other platforms. And then there is this problem of vendor lock-in, i.e. if you built your application for AWS Lambda, and want to move to GCP, good luck with that. Another problem is Language and Framework support which is certainly limited by each vendor.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, containers also have been very popular among people who want to ship their entire application as a single package with all the required dependencies in itself. This provides the flexibility of configuring your own project structure as well as frameworks and libraries. Developers love containers because if it is working on my computer it will certainly work on others' as well :D. But again, their major problem is that they do not scale down to zero i.e. you will always have something running 24/7.</p>

                        The Perfect Combination
                    </h3>
                    <p>What if the pros of both serverless and containers are combined? Cloud Run is exactly what I have been looking for a long time. Let me package my application like a container but I also want to pay only when the user uses my container. So basically <strong>Cloud Run is serverless container platform</strong>.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Real-World Example: Flask to Cloud Run</h2>

                <p>If you use Python and built a web server using Flask, you must be hosting it on a server which is running 24/7 whether user visits or not. I tried to shift my Flask app to AWS Lambda, it was quite a hassle to use Chalice instead of Flask.</p>

                <h2>Current Limitations</h2>

                <p>Even though Cloud Run is a revolutionary tech for developers, it still has some major problems. One of the major limitations I face is computed resources. Just like any other serverless platform, Cloud Run's computer resources are very limited.</p>

                <div class="limitations">
                    <h3>
                        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
                        Known Limitations
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compute Resources:</strong> Limited CPU and memory allocation compared to traditional VMs</li>
                        <li><strong>Stateless Nature:</strong> Containers cannot have persistent volumes attached</li>
                        <li><strong>Cold Starts:</strong> Initial request may experience latency when scaling from zero</li>
                        <li><strong>Request Timeout:</strong> Maximum request timeout limitations for long-running tasks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> You can use Cloud Run on GKE for more control, but that would not be 100% serverless and you'd lose the scale-to-zero benefit.

                    </h3>
                    <p>Cloud Run represents a significant step forward in cloud computing, bridging the gap between serverless functions and container orchestration. It offers developers the flexibility they need while maintaining the cost benefits of serverless architecture. As the technology matures, we can expect many of the current limitations to be addressed, making it an even more compelling choice for modern applications.</p>
